GENERAL AGREEMENTS:

    Documentation and comments language -> english
    Indentation -> 4 spaces
    Environment -> LINUX UBUNTU 64
    Function parentheses -> foo(){
                                    xxx
                                    xxx
                                 }
    Variable naming convection -> camelCase

COMMUNICATION CHANNELS:
    Discord server
        Special discord server is set up with specific rooms for each part of the project.
        Division of rooms to general communication, logs, global decisions, further division into threads.
        Discord will be also used for voice communication between members.
        Rules:
            Every member must check the server at least once a day.
            Compulsory reactions to important messages (with emoji on the message). 
            Important messages will include tag of all members.
            In agreed time before deadline all members will check the part of the project and give feedback.
            During voice calls there is one selected member that will write down important things said.
            Problematics of specific task are discussed in assigned room.
            Key words for easy lookup are used. These include but are not limited to: UPDATE, BUG, ISSUES, DECISION...
    Telephone
        When a member is radio-silent for more than 2 days, every member has the right to contact him via telephone.
        Each member has the phone number to all others.
    Email
        All members have email addresses of all others. Will be used when Discord will be insufficient.
OTHER TOOLS:
    Doodle
        Used for marking free time where members are available for calls.
    GitHub planner
        Used for tracking deadlines and completion of project.
